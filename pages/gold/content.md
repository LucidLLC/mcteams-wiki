# Gold Economy
Gold is the currency of MCTeams and the economy surrounding it is entirely player-run.

**For an in-game list of commands, run `/eco`**.

## Building a gold balance:
The simplest way to get gold is by mining it. Gold ingots can be deposited into a players balance via the  `/deposit` command.

Gold can also be accumulated by selling items to other players on the economy. Nearly every item in the game can be listed on the economy for whatever price the seller chooses. When a player buys that item, the seller gets the gold. However, **there is competition**. When a player buys an item, the economy will always give them the best (lowest) price. **The seller does not receive any gold until their item has actually been sold to another player.**

**Tip:** Check the current price of an item before selling it ensure your offer is competitive.

Gold is always safe when stored in a balance and players can withdraw it at any time in the form of gold-ingots.

## Using gold:
The main use of gold is to buy items from other players on the economy. Players sell all sorts of items, it is rare that a player cannot find what they need on the economy. Whether or not they like the price is up to them. <br />
**Tip:** Check the current price of an item before buying it to know what the price will be.

Gold also has other uses, such as [Coinflips](https://wiki.mcteams.com/coinflips) and maintaining [Salvagers](https://wiki.mcteams.com/salvaging). It is important to keep a gold balance in order to interact with every aspect of the server.
