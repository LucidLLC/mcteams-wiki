Salvage an item by right clicking the material block with it in your hand.  
**The block type must match the item type (eg. iron block for iron items).**

  
### Maintaining The Salvager

Right clicking a Salvager will open its' main menu.

Using a salvager reduces its durability. The **anvil button** is used to repair it. It costs **0.2 gold per depleted** durability to fully repair a Salvager.

Salvagers can be upgraded, offering more durability and higher material refund rates. This is done with the **green dye button**.

  
### Upgraded Salvagers:

Below is a table showing the benefits of upgraded salvagers.  
**Damaged** _refers to whether or not the Salvager can repair damaged items_  
**Output** _refers to the % of used materials refunded._

| Level | Output | Damaged | Durability |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | 50% | No | 75 |
| 2 | 100% | No | 125 | 
| 3 | 100% | Yes | 200 |

  
**Tip:** Use salvagers for items with unwanted enchantments. Recraft and enchant again!
