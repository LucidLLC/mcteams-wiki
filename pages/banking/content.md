Account Banking System

> Simply put, this is a system to dissuade players from logging out with their valuable items to keep tracking and raiding competitive.

Every item / enchantment considered "valuable" has a minimum gold cost, and a maximum gold percentage cost. For each infraction, the system will attempt to fine the player with the gold percentage of their entire balance. If that amount is less than the minimum, then it will attempt with the minimum gold cost. If the player still does not have enough gold, there is a chance the system will take the item away permanently. This is subject to change, but is currently at 40%. A list of all valuable items / enchants can be found below.
